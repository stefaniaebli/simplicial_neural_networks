> We present simplicial neural networks (SNNs), a generalization of graph neural networks to data that live on a class of topological spaces called [simplicial complexes].
> These are natural multi-dimensional extensions of graphs that encode not only pairwise relationships but also higher-order interactions between vertices—allowing us to consider richer data, including vector fields and n-fold collaboration networks.
> We define an appropriate notion of convolution that we leverage to construct the desired convolutional neural networks.
> We test the SNNs on the task of imputing missing data on coauthorship complexes.

## Reproducing our results

Run the below to train a SNN to impute missing data (citations) on the simplicial complex (which encodes collaborations between authors).

```sh
python ./experiments/impute_citations.py ./data/s2_3_collaboration_complex ./experiments/output 150250 30
```

## Data

The data necessary to reproduce our experiment are found in the [`./data/s2_3_collaboration_complex`](./data/s2_3_collaboration_complex) folder.
The below three stages will recreate them.

[Semantic Scholar]: https://semanticscholar.org
[Open Research Corpus]: https://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus

1. Download the full archive of the [Open Research Corpus] from [Semantic Scholar], version 2018-05-03, which contains over 39 million published research papers in Computer Science, Neuroscience, and Biomedical.
    ```sh
    wget -i https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-research-public/open-corpus/2018-05-03/manifest.txt -P data/s2_1_raw/
    ```
   This step populates the [`./data/s2_1_raw`](./data/s2_1_raw) folder.

2. Create a bipartite graph, whose vertices are papers (39,219,709 of them) in one part and authors (12,862,455 of them) in the other.
   A paper is connected to all its co-authors, and an author is connected to all the papers they wrote, leading to 139,268,795 edges.
   A citation count (the number of times the paper was cited) is available for each paper (from 0 to 37,230 citations per paper).
    ```sh
    # Create a bipartite graph from Semantic Scholar.
    python s2_1_corpus_to_bipartite.py
    # Clean and downsample that bipartite graph.
    python s2_2_downsample_bipartite.py
    # Project the bipartite graph to a graph between authors.
    python s2_3_bipartite_to_graphs.py
    ```
   Those steps populate the [`./data/s2_2_bipartite_graph`](./data/s2_2_bipartite_graph) folder.
   Alternatively, that processed data is available at [`doi:10.5281/zenodo.4144319`][data].

3. Build the collaboration complex (where each collaboration of authors is represented by a simplex) and citation cochains (which are the number of citations attributed to the collaborations).
    ```sh
    # Downsample the bipartite graph to have a connected simplicial complex.
    python s2_4_bipartite_to_downsampled.py
    # From a bipartite graph to a simplicial complex with k-cochains.
    python s2_5_bipartite_to_complex.py
    # From a simplicial complex to k-degree Laplacians.
    python s2_6_complex_to_laplacians.py
    # Artificially insert missing data on k-cochains.
    python s2_7_cochains_to_missingdata.py
    ```
   Those steps populate the [`./data/s2_3_collaboration_complex`](./data/s2_3_collaboration_complex) folder.
